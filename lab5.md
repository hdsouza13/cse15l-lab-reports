Student: Hello, I was trying to run my program using the bash, however it is not running and its not showing no compile error. As you can see the output is empty.

TA: Hummmmmmm. Normally when this happens, it means that the command you used was unable to find the file. Can you show me your bash file.

Student:This is what I wrote in the bash file

TA:Ohhhhh, I know your error. So normally on java programs, you need to compile the file, as you are doing using the ```javac```. However, just compiling, it is not going to run automatic your code, so you need something else to run the program.

Student:Ohhhhhh, this is true. I figure out that my code has missing the the ```java``` command to run the file.

Part 2

I learned how to use jdb, I had no idea it existed. This will help me a lot, if my program gives an error, I can compile it and divide them into parts, to see how each part is compiling. Also I learned how to code in bash script, something very new, that I never used. And the bash helped me alot to run the programs.
