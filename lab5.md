Part 1
---
Student: Hello, I was trying to run my program, I know a bash script to compile my code, but it is not trying any output.


Part 2
---
I learned how to use jdb, I had no idea it existed. This will help me a lot, if my program gives an error, I can compile it and divide them into parts, to see how each part is compiling. Also I learned how to code in bash script, something very new, that I never used. And the bash helped me alot to run the programs.
