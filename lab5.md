Part 2

I learned how to use jdb, I had no idea it existed. This will help me a lot, if my program gives an error, I can compile it and divide them into parts, to see how each part is compiling. Also I learned how to code in bash script, something very new, that I never used. And the bash helped me alot to run the programs.
